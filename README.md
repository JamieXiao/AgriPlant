AgriPlant is an interactive game that serves to educate users on agricultural sustainability. It features trivia questions, information cards, and basic simulations of real-life sustainability practices all while providing an engaging gameplay scenario suitable for interested learners. Come along for 14 days and create your own garden that harvests itself daily, but be careful of the natural and human-induced risks that often come with unsustainable agricultural practices!

The game is designed on Canva and made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Our team of two (including Emily Qi) coded it and hosted it on Firebase. This application was created in the span of 36 hours and submitted in the KatyYouthHacks 2023 Hackathon and won the Best Design.
